0.2 (16-Feb-2008)

  Renamed addProcessToGroup() to addProgramToGroup().  The method
  now supports program definitions with numprocs > 1 and will add 
  all resulting processes from the program definition.  It also
  fixes a bug where the process config was not added to the group
  properly.  Requested by Roger Hoover.
  
  Added new method log() that writes an arbitrary message to the 
  main supervisord log.  This is useful for recording information 
  about your twiddling.
